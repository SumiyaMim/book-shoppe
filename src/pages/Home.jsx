      <p>Books are a good source of information, where we can find the information 
        in a written and pictorial form. In the beginning years, they use to be in 
        a handwritten form which slowly changed into a printed one. They contain various 
        types of information and are the best form of storing knowledge. In the old days, 
        there was no internet and books were the only source of information. Even today we 
        read books, we have books each from a different subject in schools and we enjoy 
        reading them. Reading books is a very good habit and we should always promote reading.

        no printing press and books were written by hand but today we have thousands 
        of publishing houses. Reading is helpful in many ways, so always read books 
        and live a peaceful life.
